        <p class="paragraph">I am currently a rising senior at New Tech Institute. I am on the Core 40 diploma track, and am always very close to or at a 4.0 GPA. I have taken many Dual-Credit courses, and will continue to do so as a Senior.
           I also attend the Southern Indiana Career and Technical Center for half of the school day, where I recieve specialized schooling in computer science. </p>
        <h1 class="huge">Experience</h1>
        <img class="about"src="images/catapultpic.png">
        <p class="paragraph">I have never had a job, but I did have an internship at the Nextech Catapult Program in 2025. In the program, the others in the program and I learned many skills to help in computer science, and spoke with many industry professionals about their success stories. I also donate blood regularly with the Red Cross.</p>
        <h1 class="huge">Plans<br> and Goals</h1>
        <img class="about"src="images/MooAndFigaro.jpeg">
        <p class="paragraph">After I finish high school, I plan to go to a good local college and continue my pursuit of computer science while applying for internships and jobs so that I can do something with my schooling. The cat you've been seeing around the website is my cat, Moo-Moo. She's very sweet.</p>
